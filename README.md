# attack-scripts
A compilation of attack script files found on compromised &amp; neutralized C2 servers.

# Do not run any file without prior understanding of what it is supposed to do.
# This is a collection of attack script files I have personally found while practicing "Search & Destroy" on known Command & Control servers / nodes.
# Most of these files are DoS / DDoS scripts which aim to bypass WAFs via different methods.
